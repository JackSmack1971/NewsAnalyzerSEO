## Configuration

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root:
   ```sh
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   SERP_API_KEY=your_serp_api_key_here
   ```

2. Obtain API keys from:
   - OpenAI: [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/)
   - SerpAPI: [SerpAPI](https://serpapi.com/)

## Code Structure

- `news_analyzer_core.py`: Core functionality for news analysis, API interactions, and data processing.
- `news_analyzer_main.py`: Main application file integrating UI and core functionality.
- `news_analyzer_ui.py`: User interface definition using Kivy.
- `requirements.txt`: Project dependencies.

## API Documentation

The project uses the following external APIs:

1. OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo API
   - Used for: Generating search queries, summarizing articles, and analyzing sentiment.
   - Documentation: [OpenAI API Reference](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference)

2. SerpAPI
   - Used for: Fetching Google Search results, auto-complete suggestions, and related searches.
   - Documentation: [SerpAPI Docs](https://serpapi.com/docs)

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. "ModuleNotFoundError": Ensure all dependencies are installed and you're running the script from the correct directory.
2. API errors: Check your `.env` file and ensure your API keys are correct and have sufficient credits.
3. Performance issues: Try reducing the `NUM_RESULTS` constant in `news_analyzer_core.py` if analysis is taking too long.

## Performance Considerations

- The application performs best on systems with at least 4GB of RAM and a modern multi-core processor.
- Analysis time can vary from a few seconds to a minute, depending on the complexity of the query and the number of articles processed.
- Internet connection speed can significantly impact performance due to API calls.

## Data Handling and Privacy

- The application does not store any user queries or analysis results permanently.
- All data processing is done locally, except for API calls to OpenAI and SerpAPI.
- Users should review the privacy policies of OpenAI and SerpAPI for information on how these services handle data.

## Future Development

Planned features and improvements:

- Integration with additional news APIs for broader coverage
- Enhanced visualization of analysis results, including interactive graphs
- Support for topic tracking over time
- Multi-language support for international news analysis

## Testing

To run the test suite:

```sh
python -m unittest discover tests
```
